FEWD Spring 2021 Final Project

Due Date: Friday, September 10th, 2021

Scenario:

You are a group of entrepreneurs of a local startup company and you are prepared to reveal a product or service that solves a specific problem in your community, state, or of any current national or global issue.

Using everything that we have learned in this course, create a 5-page website for your start-up company. The core of your project should revolve around your company’s product or service offered by your startup. (Think: SharkTank) Your company’s product or service, message, branding, and site layout will be decided collectively among all team members.

Minimum Requirements:

0) A Git repository
1) A header on each page
2) A navigation element on each page
3) A responsive layout
4) Unanimously agreed upon, and consistent page layouts
5) A GitHub Pages URL (this should be left until the end of the project)

Optional:

0) JavaScript functionality

Do not use any of the following for this project as they will not be considered during evaluation:

   0) Existing complete website templates
   1) Any programming language that has not been covered in this course to render dynamic
   2) HTML content or any backend service
   3) Any platform, framework, or specialized program designed to accomplish a non-HTML-CSS-JavaScript task. Exceptions here are any photo manipulation software, such as Photoshop, GIMP, Inkscape,etc. or video and music editing software
   4) CSS libraries such as Bootstrap, Bulma, Semantic UI, Materialize, etc.
   5) Website generating sites, such as WordPress, Wix or Squarespace, etc.
   6) HTML frameworks such as Foundation, Drupal, Joomla, etc.

We reserve the right to ban certain tools that we have not explicitly listed.

Important:

No single person will be responsible for building the entire site by themselves. The current pandemic state can make it tough to contact people. Be sure to keep an open channel of communication within your groups.

Play up your strengths:

Whether you are a graphic designer, a natural artist, or a natural at writing creative and compelling content in any industry or if you fancy yourself technically adept – take lead on those parts of the project that require those skills. You bring the sum of your experiences to this project and you have a lot more to offer your group than just what you have learned in class.

Own your role(s)!

This is the time for outdoing yourself! Take responsibility for the work that you are in charge of and take responsibility for more when you finish the task you are working on.

Do not struggle in solitude!

If you are struggling on any part of the project, please make this known within your group first and then let me know. You may have the same question someone else will just refuse to ask. There is nothing more expensive than not being on the same page as the rest of your team. Both Gaby and I are available to help if needed.

Group Issues

If there are any issues in the group, please try to resolve them internally. If there is something that needs our intervention, please reach out to Gaby and me and we will address it.
