  <h1>About CarePak</h1>

  <p>
	The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented situation in the world of medicine and healthcare. Hospitals are overrun, understaffed, and in some cases, under-funded. Intensive Care Units across the United States, and even across the world, are filled to capacity. These problems have quickly trickled into virtually all facets of the healthcare field. Not only has it affected healthcare professionals and organizations, it has affected the reason it all exists to being with: the patient.
	It has become increasingly difficult for millions of people to maintain their health, whether they are all already sick, trying to maintain treatment for a chronic illness, or simply trying to prevent illnesses from occurring. Many people find that they cannot even make doctorâ€™s appointments, or find themselves having to wait frighteningly long amounts of time to even see a doctor. Many healthcare organizations have to do temporarily, some indefinitely, forego elective treatments/procedures due to this situation. 
	Here at CarePak, we aim to thoroughly tailor services for our customers, some of which they may find to be unavailable locally. CarePak does this by creating a personal care profile for every customer, which we use to help connect you digitally to a healthcare professional. The healthcare professionals we connect our customers  with can use the information we collect to help tailor a plan and provide guidance on products that our customers can use to try to get healthier and maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>
