  <h1>About Us</h1>
<!--Wil add the name once we agree on it-->
  <p>
	The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented situation in the world of medicine and healthcare. Hospitals are overrun, understaffed, and in some cases, under-funded. Intensive Care Units across the United States, and even across the world, are filled to capacity. These problems have quickly trickled into virtually all facets of the healthcare field. Not only has it affected healthcare professionals and organizations, it has affected the reason it all exists to being with: the patient.
	It has become increasingly difficult for millions of people to maintain their health, whether they are all already sick, trying to maintain treatment for a chronic illness, or simply trying to prevent illnesses from occurring. Many people find that they cannot even make doctorâ€™s appointments, or find themselves having to wait frighteningly long amounts of time to even see a doctor. Many healthcare organizations have to do temporarily, some indefinitely, forego elective treatments/procedures due to this situation. 
	At (insert name here), we aim to tailor services for our customers, some of which they may find to be unavailable locally. (inset name here) does this by creating a personal care profile for every customer, which we use to help connect you digitally to a healthcare professional. The healthcare professionals we connect our customers  with can use the information we collect to help tailor a plan and provide guidance on products that our customers can use to try to get healthier and maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>

	<h1>How It Works</h1>
	CarePackage is an adjustable rate subscription service, where prices reflect each individual plan fairly and affordably. We do this so we may tailor, as accurately as possible, each plan based on each customers needs. You will not be charged for things you may not need, and your needs may change as time goes on. 

	<h2>Step One: Consultation</h2>
	<p>To get started, you can schedule a consultation appointment, where you can share your specific concerns and health goals to one of our professional, knowledgable professionals. CarePackage professionals are all licensed and highly accredited physicans and dieticians. Our physicians are trusting, compassionate, and have deep knowledge the needs of people with all types of health goals. Whether you are seeking a healthier diet after heart surgery, recovering from a physical injury, suffering from a cold, or just looking to incorporate a healtheir lifestyle, CarePackage has the tools you need.*</p>

	<p>CarePackage also offers a blood testing option. We send you a small test kit, and a simple finger poke's worth of blood can be collected by the kit, in order to give our professionals a better picture of your health and your needs.</p>

	<h2>Step Two: Create A Plan</h2>
	<p>Once you complete your consultation, you will be connected with one of our highly trained medical professionals, who will make recommendations, based on your tests and your goals, and together you will create a plan that will fit your needs. </p>
